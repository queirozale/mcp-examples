MCP Examples Playground

This repository contains examples and experiments using the Model Communication Protocol (MCP). It demonstrates how to build clients and servers that communicate via standardized tool calling and messaging formats.

The goal is to test, explore, and showcase various capabilities of MCP — including tool invocation, agent workflows, and integration with language models like OpenAI and Anthropic.

🛠️ Features:

Example MCP clients and servers

Tool calling (e.g., weather API, calculators)

Handling multi-turn conversations

Experiments with AI models executing tool requests

🚀 Perfect for learning, prototyping, and contributing to MCP-based ecosystems.
